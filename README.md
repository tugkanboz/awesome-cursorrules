# Awesome Cursor Rules 🚀

**A curated showcase of modern Cursor Rules configurations for development teams**

> 🎯 **Evolution Notice**: This repository demonstrates the transition from legacy `.cursorrules` files to the powerful new **Cursor Rules** system with MDC format, rule types, and advanced organizational features.

## 🌟 What Changed: From `.cursorrules` to Cursor Rules

Cursor has revolutionized AI-assisted development by moving beyond the limitations of single-file `.cursorrules`:

| Legacy `.cursorrules` | New Cursor Rules |
|----------------------|------------------|
| ❌ Single file approach | ✅ Organized rule directories |
| ❌ Plain text only | ✅ MDC format with metadata |
| ❌ Always active | ✅ Smart rule types (Always, Auto, Manual, Agent) |
| ❌ No file organization | ✅ Nested rules for complex projects |
| ❌ Limited context | ✅ File references and templates |
| ❌ Hard to maintain | ✅ Modular and scalable |

## 🎪 Repository Overview

This repository serves as a **living showcase** of modern Cursor Rules implementations across various development scenarios:

## 🔄 The Great Migration: Before & After

### Legacy `.cursorrules` Approach
```bash
# Old way - Everything in one file
project/
├── .cursorrules    # 200+ lines of mixed rules
├── src/
└── tests/
```

**Problems with legacy approach:**
- ❌ Difficult to maintain as projects grow
- ❌ No context awareness for different file types  
- ❌ All rules active all the time
- ❌ Hard to share and collaborate on rules
- ❌ No template or example integration

### Modern Cursor Rules System
```bash
# New way - Organized, contextual, powerful
project/
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── core-standards.mdc         # Always applied
│   ├── testing-patterns.mdc       # Auto-attached to test files
│   ├── framework-specific.mdc     # Context-aware activation
│   ├── advanced-optimizations.mdc # Agent-requested when relevant
│   └── templates/
│       ├── component-template.tsx
│       ├── test-template.spec.js
│       └── api-endpoint.js
├── src/
└── tests/
```

**Benefits of modern approach:**
- ✅ Context-aware rule activation
- ✅ Organized and maintainable structure
- ✅ Template integration and file references
- ✅ Team collaboration and version control friendly
- ✅ Scalable for enterprise projects

# - Advanced techniques (agent-requested)
# - Templates and examples (manual)
```

### Phase 2: Organization
```bash
# Create modern structure
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/{core,frameworks,templates,advanced}

# Categorize existing rules
# Move content to appropriate MDC files
# Add metadata and glob patterns
```

### Phase 3: Enhancement
```bash
# Add file references and templates
# Implement different rule types
# Create project-specific examples
# Test rule activation patterns
```
