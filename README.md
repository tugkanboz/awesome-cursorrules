# Awesome Cursor Rules 🚀

**A curated showcase of modern Cursor Rules configurations for development teams**

> 🎯 **Evolution Notice**: This repository demonstrates the transition from legacy `.cursorrules` files to the powerful new **Cursor Rules** system with MDC format, rule types, and advanced organizational features.

## 🌟 What Changed: From `.cursorrules` to Cursor Rules

Cursor has revolutionized AI-assisted development by moving beyond the limitations of single-file `.cursorrules`:

| Legacy `.cursorrules` | New Cursor Rules |
|----------------------|------------------|
| ❌ Single file approach | ✅ Organized rule directories |
| ❌ Plain text only | ✅ MDC format with metadata |
| ❌ Always active | ✅ Smart rule types (Always, Auto, Manual, Agent) |
| ❌ No file organization | ✅ Nested rules for complex projects |
| ❌ Limited context | ✅ File references and templates |
| ❌ Hard to maintain | ✅ Modular and scalable |

## 🎪 Repository Overview

This repository serves as a **living showcase** of modern Cursor Rules implementations across various development scenarios:

## 🔄 The Great Migration: Before & After

### Legacy `.cursorrules` Approach
```bash
# Old way - Everything in one file
project/
├── .cursorrules    # 200+ lines of mixed rules
├── src/
└── tests/
```

**Problems with legacy approach:**
- ❌ Difficult to maintain as projects grow
- ❌ No context awareness for different file types  
- ❌ All rules active all the time
- ❌ Hard to share and collaborate on rules
- ❌ No template or example integration

### Modern Cursor Rules System
```bash
# New way - Organized, contextual, powerful
project/
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── core-standards.mdc         # Always applied
│   ├── testing-patterns.mdc       # Auto-attached to test files
│   ├── framework-specific.mdc     # Context-aware activation
│   ├── advanced-optimizations.mdc # Agent-requested when relevant
│   └── templates/
│       ├── component-template.tsx
│       ├── test-template.spec.js
│       └── api-endpoint.js
├── src/
└── tests/
```

**Benefits of modern approach:**
- ✅ Context-aware rule activation
- ✅ Organized and maintainable structure
- ✅ Template integration and file references
- ✅ Team collaboration and version control friendly
- ✅ Scalable for enterprise projects

## 🎨 Understanding Rule Types

### 🔄 Always Rules
Core standards that apply to every AI interaction:
```markdown
---
description: Universal coding standards for all projects
alwaysApply: true
---

# Core Development Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety across all projects
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Follow established architectural patterns
```

### 🎯 Auto Attached Rules  
Automatically activated based on file patterns:
```markdown
---
description: React component development patterns
globs: **/*.tsx,**/components/**/*.js,**/hooks/**/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

# React Development Excellence
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Follow component composition patterns
- Optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback

@react-component-template.tsx
@custom-hook-template.ts
```

### 🤖 Agent Requested Rules
AI intelligently applies based on context:
```markdown
---
description: Advanced performance optimization techniques
globs: **/*.js,**/*.ts,**/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false
---

# Performance Optimization Strategies
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Optimize bundle size and loading times
- Monitor and profile application performance
```

### 📝 Manual Rules
Explicitly invoked with `@ruleName`:
```markdown
---
description: Complete test automation setup generator
alwaysApply: false
---

# Test Automation Project Generator
Creates a complete test automation project structure:

@selenium-project-structure
@cypress-configuration  
@playwright-setup
@github-actions-ci
```

## 📄 AGENTS.md: The Simpler Alternative

Alongside `.mdc` rules, Cursor now supports **`AGENTS.md`** — a plain Markdown file (no frontmatter, no metadata) that Cursor reads as project guidance. It's the lowest-friction way to give the agent context, and it's portable across other AI coding tools that adopt the same convention.

```bash
project/
├── AGENTS.md                # Project-wide guidance (always read)
├── frontend/
│   └── AGENTS.md            # Frontend-specific guidance
└── backend/
    └── AGENTS.md            # Backend-specific guidance
```

**How it works:**
- ✅ Plain Markdown — just write instructions, no YAML frontmatter
- ✅ **Nested directories**: an `AGENTS.md` deeper in the tree takes precedence over a parent one for files in that subtree
- ✅ Great for tech-stack notes, conventions, and "how to run things" that should always be in context

**`AGENTS.md` vs `.mdc` rules — when to use which:**

| Use `AGENTS.md` | Use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Always-on project context | Context-aware, file-scoped activation |
| Simple, portable, no metadata | `globs`, `description`, `alwaysApply` control |
| One file per directory | Multiple focused rules per project |

> 💡 Note: `.cursor/rules/` only loads files with the `.mdc` extension — a plain `.md` placed there is ignored, *except* when it's named `AGENTS.md`.
