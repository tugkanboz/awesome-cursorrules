# Project: Selenium Python Test Automation Framework

## Framework Structure
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Implement Page Object Model pattern
- Maintain conftest.py for fixture management
- Use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for better code readability
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (black formatter standard)
- Use snake_case for function and variable names

## Test Organization
- Group tests using pytest markers
- Use parametrize for data-driven tests
- Implement test categories (smoke, regression, etc.)
- Keep test files organized by features

## Best Practices
- Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- Implement proper logging using Python's logging module
- Use pytest-html for report generation
- Implement screenshot capture for failed tests
- Use soft assertions when appropriate

## WebDriver Management
- Use webdriver_manager for browser setup
- Implement cross-browser testing
- Handle driver configurations through pytest.ini
- Implement headless mode for CI/CD

## Test Data Management
- Use YAML/JSON files for test data
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Use pytest fixtures for data management
- Keep sensitive data in environment variables

## Utility Functions
- Create reusable helper functions
- Implement custom wait conditions
- Add browser specific utilities
- Create common assertion functions

## Documentation
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Maintain requirements.txt
- Create detailed README.md
- Document test cases in Gherkin format when applicable

## Code Quality
- Use black for code formatting
- Implement pylint/flake8 for code quality
- Regular code reviews
- Use mypy for type checking

## CI/CD Integration
- Configure GitHub Actions/Jenkins pipeline
- Set up Docker containers for test execution
- Implement test result reporting
- Configure parallel execution settings

Remember to handle dynamic elements, browser variations, and environmental differences effectively.
