# Project: RestAssured API Testing Framework

## Framework Structure
- Use Maven for project management
- Implement modular test structure
- Create separate packages for requests, responses, and tests
- Use POJO classes for request/response models

## Coding Standards
- Follow Java code conventions
- Use proper naming for test methods (should_return_expectedResponse_when_condition)
- Implement builder pattern for request construction
- Keep methods focused and concise

## Test Organization
- Group tests by API endpoints
- Use TestNG for test execution
- Implement test priorities
- Create separate suites for different types of API tests

## Best Practices
- Use specification builders for repeated request parts
- Implement proper response validation
- Use JsonSchema validation
- Handle authentication properly
- Implement retry mechanism for flaky tests

## Request/Response Handling
- Use POJO classes with Jackson annotations
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization
- Handle different content types
- Proper error handling and assertions

## Authentication
- Handle different auth methods (Basic, OAuth, JWT)
- Secure credential management
- Implement token management
- Handle session management when required

## Test Data Management
- Use JSON/YAML files for test data
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Use TestNG data providers
- Handle test data cleanup

## Reporting
- Use Allure reporting
- Include request/response details in reports
- Log test steps and assertions
- Generate comprehensive test execution reports

## Documentation
- Use JavaDoc for all methods
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Maintain up-to-date README
- Include setup instructions and examples

## Performance Considerations
- Implement response time assertions
- Handle concurrent API requests
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement connection pooling

## CI/CD Integration
- Configure for Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- Set up different environment configurations
- Implement parallel execution
- Configure report generation

Remember to handle rate limiting, API versioning, and different environment configurations properly.
